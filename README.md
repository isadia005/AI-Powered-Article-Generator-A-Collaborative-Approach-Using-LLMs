    <h1>AI-Powered Article Generator</h1>
        <p><strong>Project Overview:</strong></p>
        <p>This project is an AI-powered article generator that utilizes two large language models (LLMs) to create and refine articles. The first LLM, Groq Llama3, writes the initial draft, while the second LLM, Mistral-Tiny, critiques and provides feedback to improve it. The final article is enhanced using Gemini Pro for better readability and coherence. Users can input a title, description, and desired word count to generate a polished article, which can be saved in TXT, PDF, or DOCX formats. This project demonstrates the collaborative potential of multiple LLMs in content creation.</p>
